        description="Magnetic materials are substances that exhibit notable magnetic properties. The fundamental characteristic of these materials is their ability to be influenced by external magnetic fields and, in many cases, to retain a magnetic field of their own. The study of magnetic materials is a critical part of material science, physics, and engineering, with a range of applications across various fields."
